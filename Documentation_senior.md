# KalaVriddhi Project Documentation

## Overview

KalaVriddhi is a website designed to educate users about Indian culture and heritage through interactive 3D visuals, gamified quizzes, learning modules, and a Bharatanatyam dance simulator.  This document provides a technical overview for senior developers.

## Website Functionality

The website offers the following key features:

* **Interactive 3D Visuals:**  Presents 3D models and interactive elements to engage users with cultural artifacts and concepts.
* **Gamified Quizzes and Modules:** Implements interactive quizzes and learning modules to enhance the learning experience.
* **Bharatanatyam Dance Simulator:**  A core feature allowing users to interact with and learn about Bharatanatyam dance.  This simulator analyzes uploaded audio files and generates corresponding dance sequences, visualized through 3D models.
* **Admin Page:** Provides administrative functionalities accessible with designated credentials.

## Technical Architecture

The project is structured as a web application, likely utilizing a client-server model.  The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging libraries like Babylon.js for 3D rendering and Wavesurfer.js for audio waveform visualization.

### Dance Simulator

The dance simulator is a central component of the application.  Key functionalities include:

* **Audio Input:**  Accepts audio files via a file upload input element.
* **Frequency Analysis:**  Processes the uploaded audio, performing frequency analysis using JavaScript and potentially a library like Web Audio API.
* **Dance Sequence Generation:** Based on the analyzed frequencies, a sequence of dance steps is generated. This logic is implemented in JavaScript and likely involves mapping frequency ranges to specific dance moves.
* **3D Visualization:** The generated dance sequence is rendered using Babylon.js, visualizing the steps with a 3D model.  Multiple canvases display a sequence of poses representing the dance.


### Dependencies

* **Babylon.js:**  A JavaScript library used for creating 3D graphics in web browsers.  Handles rendering and animation of the 3D models within the dance simulator.
* **Wavesurfer.js:** A JavaScript library for displaying and interacting with audio waveforms. Used for visualizing the uploaded audio files.
* **Frontend Technologies:** Core web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) form the foundation of the application's user interface and logic.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on Render, a cloud platform for web applications. The deployment URL is: https://kalavriddhi-frontend-6cyz.onrender.com/

## UML Diagrams

The project includes UML diagrams for visualizing the system's design:

* **Class Diagram:** Illustrates the classes and their relationships within the application's structure.
* **Sequence Diagram:** Depicts the interactions between objects and the flow of control within specific scenarios, likely focusing on the dance simulator's audio processing and visualization logic.

## Recent Updates

* **Model Updates:** Improved 3D models by removing older, less effective versions.
* **README Updates:** The README file has been updated to reflect recent changes and improvements, providing clearer instructions and information on admin login credentials.
